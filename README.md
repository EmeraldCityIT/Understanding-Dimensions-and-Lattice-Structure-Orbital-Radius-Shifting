# Understanding-Dimensions-and-Lattice-Structure-Orbital-Radius-Shifting
Dimensions are levels of existance at available electron orbitals within a targeted lattice structure. Stable materials exist with molecules that resonate on associated stable energy levels. A universal shift within a lattice structure by moving all attributed electrons up or down an energy level changes the size and frequency of an object by many measures. When two lattice structures exist on the same plane in different dimmensions, the object with the higher energy level will crush the smaller, lower energy lattice structure.
